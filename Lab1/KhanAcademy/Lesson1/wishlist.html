        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.<br>
        Because the most <strong>beautiful</strong>, <em>complex</em> concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere</strong> can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
