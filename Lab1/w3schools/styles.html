<pre>The game is a loose adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy: The<br> Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). As it<br> is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Lord of the Rings, anything<br> from the novels not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. <br></pre>
